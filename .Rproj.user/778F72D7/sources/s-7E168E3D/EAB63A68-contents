# 1. Introduction ---------------------------------------------------------

# `geom_smooth()` is a very useful geometry which can often be used along with
# the point plot. This geometry generates a trend line which can be estimated
# either via the linear regression, or some other, more complicated, function.

# The default call of this geometry is simple:
ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = earnings, color = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

# Trend is estimated with GAM model. Nice article about this model is available 
# here:
# https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/assets/files/gam.pdf
# https://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2015/07/30/gam/

# different algorithm is used for small samples:
ggplot(data = spare.time[1:500,], aes(x = age, y = earnings, color = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

# Loess is the local polynomial fitting.
# The idea of this method is that the trend for the whole sample determined from
# trends of homogeneous subsamples into which the sample is split by
# e.g. the `k` nearest neighbours algorithm.
# More on that [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression).

# If you are interested in obtaining a more closely fit trend then you can use
# the `span` argument, but only in loess algorithm (accepts values between 0 and 1, 
# the closer to 0 the curve is more flexible):
ggplot(data = spare.time[1:500,], aes(x = age, y = earnings, color = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(span = 1)

# One of the other options is the `method` argument. Using it, one can define
# a method which will be used to obtain the trend curve, e.g. a line with
# coefficients obtained from the linear regression:
ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = earnings, color = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")


# 2. Defining formula -----------------------------------------------------

# We can define the `formula` argument which will allow us to define the functional 
# form of the trend::
ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = earnings, color = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, size = 1)

# We can modify the functional form of the regression and try to fit the second order polynomial:
ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = earnings, color = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x + I(x^2), size = 1)

# The `poly` function is very useful for polynomials of higher degree:
ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = earnings, color = age)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              formula = y ~ poly(x, 4) # first argument - variable, second - polynomial degree
              , size = 1)

# Now let's try to fit a square root and log functions:
ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = earnings, color = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              formula = y ~ log(x)
              , size = 1)

ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = earnings, color = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              formula = y ~ sqrt(x)
              , size = 1)

# 3. Additional parameters -----------------------------------------------------

# In `geom_smooth` we also can use the following arguments:

# * _linetype_, (what would be the type of the displayed trend line),
# * _fill_ (allows to control the display of the standard error),
# * _alpha_ (allows to control the transparency of display of the standard error range).
ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = earnings, color = age)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              formula = y ~ poly(x, 2) # first argument - variable, second - polynomial degree
              , fill = "green"
              , col = "darkgreen"
              , alpha = 0.2)

# 4. Grouping and faceting ------------------------------------------------

# The trend lines can be displayed in subgroups, e.g. by coloring points along the lines:
ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = earnings, color = education)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

# or just lines:
ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = earnings)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(aes(color = education), se = FALSE, size = 2)

# We can also use the `facet_wrap` function to split plot into multiple subplots:
ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = earnings)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() +
  facet_wrap(~education)

# 5. glm() and geom_smooth() ----------------------------------------------

# Ultimately, we can also fit any other function, e.g. a logistic model.
# In the example below we will try to model the probability of respondent
# in a given age having children in household:
ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = any_children)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'glm', method.args = list(family = binomial(link = 'logit')),
              formula = y ~ x)

ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, y = any_children, color = education)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = 'glm', method.args = list(family = binomial(link = 'logit')),
              formula = y ~ x)

# 6. Printing formula on the graph -------------------------------------------

install.packages('ggpmisc')
library(ggpmisc)

# Thanks to the ggpmisc package, we can print estimated formula of trend on the
# graph:

formula <- y ~ poly(x, 3, raw = TRUE)
formula2 <- y ~ poly(x, 2, raw = TRUE)

ggplot(data = spare.time, aes(x = age, earnings)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = formula) +
  stat_poly_eq(aes(label =  paste(stat(eq.label), stat(adj.rr.label), sep = "~~~~")),
               formula = formula, parse = TRUE,
               label.x = 35, label.y = 3500, color = 'blue') +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = formula2, color = 'red') +
  stat_poly_eq(aes(label =  paste(stat(eq.label), stat(adj.rr.label), sep = "~~~~")),
               formula = formula2, parse = TRUE,
               label.x = 0, label.y = 3300, color = 'red')

# 7. ggalt and splines ----------------------------------------------------

# Another proposition of estimating trend is available in ggalt package:
library(ggalt)

set.seed(1492)
dat <- data.frame(x=c(1:10, 1:10, 1:10),
                  y=c(sample(15:30, 10), 2*sample(15:30, 10), 4*sample(15:30, 10)),
                  group=factor(c(rep(1, 10), rep(2, 10), rep(3, 10)))
)

ggplot(dat, aes(x, y, group=group, color=group)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()

ggplot(dat, aes(x, y, group=group, color=factor(group))) +
  geom_point() +
  # geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, linetype="dashed", size=0.5)

ggplot(dat, aes(x, y, group=group, color=factor(group))) +
  geom_point(color="black") +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, linetype="dashed", size=0.5) +
  geom_xspline(size=0.5)

ggplot(dat, aes(x, y, group=group, color=factor(group))) +
  geom_point(color="black") +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, linetype="dashed", size=0.5) +
  geom_xspline(spline_shape=-1, size=0.5)

ggplot(dat, aes(x, y, group=group, color=factor(group))) +
  geom_point(color="black") +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, linetype="dashed", size=0.5) +
  geom_xspline(spline_shape=1, size=0.5)

ggplot(dat, aes(x, y, group=group, color=factor(group))) +
  geom_point(color="black") +
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, linetype="dashed", size=0.5) +
  geom_xspline(spline_shape=0, size=0.5)

# 8. Excercises ----------------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Investigate the dependance of time of sleep vs the respondent's age.
# Compare the results of people with a different number of children and put
# the subsequent plots one next to each other. Mark the points on different
# plots using different colours. Prepare the investigation using first
# 500 observations from the database.



# 2. Create a point plot showing a dependance between the amount of time spent
# on working and the average weekly salary for respondents who work more than
# 0 minutes per day and earn more than 0 USD per week.
# Add a trend line to the plot. Then, check if trends differ for:

# a) day of week when the respondent was surveyed,
# b) respondent's gender,
# c) respondent's education level.

# You can compare the trends either on 3 separate plots or a single multiplot.

# 3. Import Walmart datasets. Estimate trend for given time series, e. g. weekly 
# sales or temperature. Don't forget to aggregate data first!!


# 4. Import dataset mpg:
data(mpg, package="ggplot2")

# Then pick four favourites manufucturers and plot for them scatterplot, where 
# disp variable will be mapped on X, cty on y. Next:

# a. Estimate and plot linear trend for whole subset and for each group
# b. Try to plot formula for equations on the graph. Does it works color aesthetic?
# Does it work with faceting?
